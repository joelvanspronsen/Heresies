        <h2> Description</h2>
      <p> Marcionism was an early christian dualist belief system that originated in the teachings of Marcion of Sinope  at Rome 
        He believed that Jesus was the Saviour sent by God and that Paul the apostle was his chief apostle 
        But he rejected the Hebrew BIble and the God of Israel
        All people who believed this also thought that the wrathful God of the hebrews was lower than the all forgiving God of the new testament. 
        A primary difference between Marcionites and Gnostics was that the Gnostics based their theology on secret wisdom.   
        Tertullian, along with Epiphanius of Salamis, also charged that Marcion set aside the gospels of Matthew, Mark and John, and used Luke alone
        Marcion's salvation will be the attainment only of those souls which had learned his doctrine; while the body, as having been taken from the earth, is incapable of sharing in salvation.

    <h2> Debates that occured</h2>
    <p> Because of their rejection of the Old Testament, the Marcionites are believed by some Christians to be anti-Semitic. Indeed, the word Marcionism is sometimes used in modern times to refer to anti-Jewish tendencies in Christian churches, especially when such tendencies are thought to be surviving residues of ancient Marcionism.

    <h2>  Official responses to these Heresies</h2>
    <p>  Tertullian cited Luke 6:43-45 (a good tree does not produce bad fruit) and Luke 5:36-38 (nobody tears a piece from a new garment to patch an old garment or puts new wine in old wineskins) in theorizing that Marcion set about to recover the authentic teachings of Jesus.
