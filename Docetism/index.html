        <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Jesus was pure spirit and his physical form was an illusion. He was not truly human.</p> 

    <h2>Debates</h2>
    <p> Some disputes contended over whether Christ assumed the "psychic" flesh of mankind as heirs to Adam, or the "spiritual" flesh of the resurrection.</p>
    <h2>  Official responses to these Heresies</h2>
    <p>  Ignatius of Antioch said: “ They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer, because they confess not the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again. They who deny the gift of God are perishing in their disputes.” 
        <ol> The Heidelberg Catechism says so clearly in Q/A 15 and 16. <li> Q. What kind of mediator and deliverer
        should we look for then? A. One who is a true and righteous human, yet more powerful than all creatures,that is, one who is also true God.</li>
       <li> Q. Why must the mediator be a true and righteous human?
        A. God’s justice demands that human nature, which has sinned,must pay for sin; but a sinful human could never pay for others.</li> </ol>
