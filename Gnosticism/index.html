            <h2> Description</h2>
            <p> Gnosticism is when they believe the world was created by an evil named Demiurge and not by God; They think this because of the imperfection and tragedy of the world
                Reject that God became incarnate
                Think God is far from his creation. 
                They think salvation is to escape from evil through knowledge.

            <h2> Debates that occured as a result</h2>
            <p>  <ol><li>In Emperor Constantine, in 325, called a general Council because there was such division. The Gnostics invited did not show up, so it was denounced as a heresy.</li> <li> The Christian heresiologists, most notably Irenaeus, regarded Gnosticism as a Christian heresy.</li> </ol> </p>
            <h2> Official responses to these Heresies.</h2>
            <p>The Nicene creed - plays a major role in maintaining unity of the church based on the truth of the Scripture.</p>
