        <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Montanism is when they relied on prophetic revelations from the Holy Spirit. 
        Montanism is named after a man named Montanus who became a convert to Christianity around A.D. 170.
        </p> 

    <h2>Debates</h2>
     <p> The early church rejected Montanus and the prophetesses and their prophecies. The rejection was based on the biblical examples of other prophets.
    </p>
    <h2>  Official responses to these Heresies</h2>
    <p>There was not really any response. The Montanists just slowly disappeared. In the 6th century, on the orders of the Emperor Justinian, John of Ephesus led an expedition to Pepuza to destroy the Montanist shrine there, which was based on the tombs of Montanus, Priscilla and Maximilla.  in the 8th century; the Emperor Leo III ordered the conversion and baptism of its members. These Montanists refused, locked themselves in their houses of worship, set the buildings on fire and perished.
